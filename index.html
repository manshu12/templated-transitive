								<p> I believe that if life gives you lemons, you should make lemonade... And try to find somebody whose life has given them vodka, and have a party.We have created the ultimate Lemon Blueberry Bars – the perfect solution for when you don’t know what to bring to your Sunday family pot-luck. Who can resist a delicious lemon cream cheese filling on a buttery cookie crust, studded with fresh blueberries and topped off with an irresistible crumble? We sure can't!</p>
								<p>To make this recipe, we’ve partnered with Becel to try out their new Becel Sticks. They come in four convenient, pre-measured sticks that can replace butter 1:1 and are soft right from the fridge for whenever impromptu baking strikes. Not only are they made with plant-based oils from canola, they also have 50% less saturated fat than butter and are a source of Omega-3 and vitamins A and D. So you know we’ll be baking these perfectly creamy and tart Lemon Blueberry Bars all summer long.</p>

										<h2>Tiramisu</h2>
										<p>Tiramisu is a rich treat blending the bold flavors of cocoa and espresso with savory mascarpone cheese and wine, layered with ladyfinger biscuits.</p>
									</header>
									<hr />
									<p>Tiramisu quite literally means, “a pick me up.” At many Italian tables, a meal is often finished with fresh fruit rather than dessert. Dessert is reserved for special occasions. Today a number of tiramisu variations are available. One popular alternative includes chocolate tiramisu, in which chocolate takes the place of the coffee.</p>

						<h2>To me, My Recipes are priceless</h2>
						<p>Cooking is one of the strongest ceremonies for life. When recipes are put together, the kitchen is a chemical laboratory involving air, fire, water and the earth. This is what gives value to humans and elevates their spiritual qualities. If you take a frozen box and stick it in the microwave, you become connected to the factory.</p>
