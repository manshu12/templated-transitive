								<h2>Smoothy</h2>
								<p>As far juicing goes, I've done it for a couple of years; it's very good to cleanse the body. Doing the smoothies and getting the fruits and veggies in there just gives you more energy. You'll feel quite different after a couple weeks of doing it. Be consistent with it and you'll see it really makes a difference.</p>
                                <p>Here we got some history about it!</p>

							<p> The healthfulness of a smoothie depends on its ingredients and their proportions. Many smoothies include large servings of fruits and vegetables which are recommended in a healthful diet. However, too many sweet fruits and fruit juices can lead to too much sugar. Similarly, ingredients such as protein powders, sweeteners, or ice cream are often used in smoothie recipes, but are not necessarily healthful.</p>
							<p>Smoothies include dietary fiber (e.g. pulp, often also skin and seeds) and so are thicker than fruit juice, with a consistency similar to a milkshake. The fiber makes smoothies more healthful than fruit juice alone. Smoothies—particularly green smoothies (which include vegetables)—are often marketed to health-conscious people, for example as a healthier alternative to milkshakes.</p>
                            <p>Some commercial smoothies, however, have added sugar, which can more than double their carbohydrate content. The fact that smoothies can be quickly swallowed without chewing makes them less effective in providing a lasting hunger-inhibiting effect than eating the raw fruit/vegetables they contain.</p>
                            <p>A smoothie (occasionally spelled smoothee or smoothy) is a thick, cold beverage made from pureed raw fruit (and sometimes vegetables) blended with ice cream or frozen yogurt, along with other ingredients such as water, crushed ice, fruit juice, sweeteners (e.g. honey, sugar, stevia, syrup), dairy products (e.g. milk, yogurt, or cottage cheese, whey powder), plant milk, nuts, nut butter, seeds, tea, chocolate, herbal supplements, or nutritional supplements. A smoothie containing dairy products is similar to a milkshake, though the latter typically contains less fruit and often contains ice cream or frozen yogurt.</p>

						<h2>To me, My Recipes are priceless</h2>
						<p>Cooking is one of the strongest ceremonies for life. When recipes are put together, the kitchen is a chemical laboratory involving air, fire, water and the earth. This is what gives value to humans and elevates their spiritual qualities. If you take a frozen box and stick it in the microwave, you become connected to the factory.</p>
